<H3>about</H3>
    As a person that has spent the majority of his life inside of the prison system (45+ years)and four years in the military (U.S. Navy).I left a lot of good people behind and feel obligated to do whatever I can  to assist them in adjusting to dealing with life on life's terms in this new society. (On a personal level; beginning with my time in the military: I spent quite a few years soaking up the 'night life' and using drugs (the great white horse).
    As of this month (11 April 2019) I have been drug free for the last 35 ears. It is my desire to utilize past experiences and events, including formal educational classes to help those in need.
